Simple thing for compressing english text (poorly)

I wanted to try making a compression algorithm without looking up how compression algorithms normally work. 
Unsurprisingly, the result is not nearly as good as the real deal, but it's not bad either.

Tests:
The Declaration of Independence - 63.6%
Romeo & Juliet - 76.2%
Frankenstein - 64.8%
